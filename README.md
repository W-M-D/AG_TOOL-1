# AG_TOOL-1

One of my first from scratch electronic projects was a electrical ac heater with a thermocouple based control system. After needing some for work I decided to see if I could find a premade solution. I was very disappointed with my search. They all cost thousands of dollars and lacked raspberry pis. Since then I have set out to create an open source all-in-one heating system with logging and automatic control ( timing controlled runs auto shutoff etc). This is what I have come up with so far.
